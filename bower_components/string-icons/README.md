# Why another icon set?

There is no lack of linear icon font freebies on the web today. Just do a google search and you'll find a neverending list of free downloadable iconsets with 20-100 icons each. **So why add to the list?**

Of all the icons out there, none of the linear icon sets I found had **everything** I needed for an application. They all seem to be missing something that I just can't go without. And the thought of combining different icon sets with different styles just makes me cringe.

In the interest of keeping a solid, consistent set of **linear icons** on hand for personal and commercial applications, I created these. They are in their beginnings, but I plan to keep updating them regularly. My goal is to eventually provide the amount of extensibility as fontawesome and other large icon sets.

I would also love to get others involved in design and/or criticism. *See below on how to contribute*

# How to use em?

####Install with bower:####
```
bower install string-icons
```
####Or install manually:####

Download the **strings.css** file, and the **fonts** folder. Place both in the same directory.

Then just load the file into your index.html:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/strings/strings.css" />
```

# Contribute

####Design####

1. Download the **strings.ai** file, and add your own icons.
2. Fork this repo and put your new illustrator file in the repo.
3. I'll grab the illustrator file and look at adding the icons if they work out.

####Suggest or Criticize####

Notice any small pixel imperfection?
Want something added to the list?
Think an icon is just uggo and needs to look better?

Just create a new issue and let me know :)
